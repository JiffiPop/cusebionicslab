                <span>Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) Controller Development</span>
            </h1>
                <p>
While I was at home for the summer between my sophomore and junior year of college I did my best to keep myself 
technical and busy by taking an online edX course to learn Python and delivering pizzas during the night shift.
&nbsp;The following semester, I would take an introductory course for electrical engineering, and as an attempt to
get a head start I watched Louis Rossmann's videos on electrical engineering.
&nbsp;This was my inspiration for looking into development of a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI)
Controller because I was unable to find one that I liked that was available in the store.
&nbsp;I bought an Arduino along with some necessary components, and began fiddling with it.
&nbsp;Learning this code was extremely painful, and required mostly help from the Arduino forums.
&nbsp;Nonetheless, the problem was eventually solved and I had developed a working MIDI controller.
<br><br>
Additionally, I eventually decided to develop an enclosure with more components than I had.
&nbsp;I wanted to develop a controller that from the outside looked as close as possible to one in production.
&nbsp;Here are some snapshots of my physical prototype, along with my CAD design of the enclosure and its respective
components.
