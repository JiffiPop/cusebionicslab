In May of 2020, I began working for my Control Systems professor at Syracuse University's Bionics 
and Control Systems Laboratory with several other students, two of whom were working to 
obtain a PhD.
&nbsp;The premise of this research was to develop a system where paraplegic patients could initially
exercise their muscles after being bedridden or using a wheelchair for a significant amount of time.
&nbsp;This could potentially allow patients to gain the strength to walk after multiple iterations of 
this assisted exercise by exploiting the muscles they already have.
&nbsp;This is also referred to as gait rehabilitation.

</p>
There are two main steps for this process.
&nbsp;The first step is to utilize the stationary bike.
&nbsp;The bike itself its a tricycle featuring a motor connected into the drivechain system,
and cloth electrodes that are placed on the patient's thighs.
&nbsp;In short, the way this works is the electrodes involuntarily contract the patient's muscles and force
them to pedal.
&nbsp;This works in conjunction with the motor to assist the pedalling motion as the electrodes alone are 
not enough to do so.
&nbsp;Exercising with the bike for multiple sessions can build enough muscle to the point where the patient
can walk utilizing the lower-limb exoskeleton suit.
</p>

<h1>Exoskeleton Design</h1>
<p>
Once a substantial amount of the patient's muscle has been built, the exoskeleton can be used.
&nbsp;This is where I came in.
&nbsp;My main assignment to complete throughout the summer was to design and fabricate the mechanical
frame for an exoskeleton suit.
&nbsp;I was able to work closely with both my professor, Dr. Duenas, and one of the PhD students.
&nbsp;They both explained to me what they were looking for in the exoskeleton frame in terms of size 
specifications for varying patients, and the features it required to control it.
&nbsp;Shown below are the results of my work.
