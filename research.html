In May of 2020, I began working for my Control Systems professor in Syracuse University's Bionics 
and Control Systems Laboratory with six other students, two of whom were working to 
obtain a PhD.
&nbsp;At the time, the laboratory was brand new and research had only been conducted for a couple of months.
&nbsp;It was a very exciting time to be working in the lab largely due to the latest and greatest
technology for model-based human motion tracking, 3D sculpting, and powerful motors that laid right in 
front of me.
  
<br><br>
The premise of this research lab was to develop a system where paraplegic patients could initially
exercise their muscles after being bedridden or using a wheelchair for a significant amount of time.
&nbsp;This could potentially allow patients to gain the strength to walk after multiple iterations of 
this assisted exercise by exploiting the muscles they already have.
&nbsp;This is also referred to as gait rehabilitation.
<br><br>
There are two main steps for this process.
&nbsp;The first step is to utilize the stationary bike.
&nbsp;The bike itself its a tricycle featuring a motor connected into the drivechain system,
and cloth electrodes that are placed on the patient's thighs.
&nbsp;In short, the way this works is the electrodes involuntarily contract the patient's muscles and force
them to pedal.
&nbsp;This works in conjunction with the motor to assist the pedalling motion as the electrodes alone are 
not enough to do so.
&nbsp;Exercising with the bike for multiple sessions can build enough muscle to the point where the patient
can walk utilizing the lower-limb exoskeleton suit.

Once a substantial amount of muscle has been built, the exoskeleton can be used.  The

The main task I was assigned to complete throughout the summer was to design the mechanical frame for
an exoskeleton suit.
&nbsp;I was able to work closely with both my professor, Dr. Due√±as, and one of the PhD students.
&nbsp;They both explained to me what they were looking for in the exoskeleton frame in terms of size 
specifications for potential patients.
